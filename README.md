# Test Driven Rampup

This is a repo designed for learning the JavaScript syntax by doing simple algorithm problems and slowly ramping up the difficulty and the requests.

All problems are thoroughly unit-tested and each separate requirement has a separate unit test.

## Installation

1. Install NodeJS:  https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone this repo using git
3. Open a terminal (cmder, command prompt, git bash) in the project folder (the one you cloned)
4. Run the command ```npm i``` and wait for it to complete

## Updating

If you already cloned the repo and want to have the latest version just run ```git pull``` in the terminal, then run ```npm i``` again.

## Usage
In your terminal run ```npm test``` (make sure you are in the project folder). 

This will open a browser tab for you with the test results. The results will be automatically updated as you work. 

You can now start implementing the tasks found in the files inside the ```/src``` folder. Tasks are grouped by difficulty.

The goal is to make all tests pass (green in the browser tab).

## Alternate usage

You can also use Visual Studio Code with the Jest plugin and open the apropriate test file to see which tests are failing and which are passing.

# Test Driven Rampup

This is a repo designed for learning the JavaScript syntax by doing simple algorithm problems and slowly ramping up the difficulty and the requests.

All problems are thoroughly unit-tested and each separate requirement has a separate unit test.

## Installation and usage

1. Install NodeJS:  https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone this repo using git
3. Open a terminal (cmder, command prompt, git bash) in the project folder (the one you cloned)
4. Run the command ```npm i``` and wait for it to complete

You can now start implementing the tasks found in the files inside the ```/src``` folder.

To run the tests run the command ```npm test``` in the above terminal. You can also use Visual Studio Code with the Jest plugin and open the apropriate test file to see which tests are failing and which are passing.
